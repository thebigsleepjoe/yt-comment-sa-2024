1. (96.47%) *@giatoyama    "Definitely a jackass" if he was actually that fucking good then he had a right to be a jackass! He definitely didn't deserve to be cheated out of his top spot???  If they thought he was cheating they could have taken that up with him but it really just seemed like they didn't like that he was better than them and confident about it.*

2. (96.31%) *@SeriousStriker    Sure you can think this, you can theorize this, you can go based on vibes, but we can't ever actually ask him.   The people in the situation, runners number 2 through 4 who could've asked him, said "nah fuck this guy he plays too much" cause he was better than them. They could and should have brought it up to him at the time, but as far as we and anybody else knows now Sasha was THE BEST runner by far that ANYBODY had seen up until that point. I mean he was literally sniping the times as soon as they got fucking said that's so crazy.*
